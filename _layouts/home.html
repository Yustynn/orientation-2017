  <div>LOGOS</div>
  <p>The Grid is a virtual world. Every year, a prestigious survival competition, The Tachyon Games, would be held, attracting players from all over to enter the Grid. Under the guidance of past Tachyon Gamesâ€™ winners, Champions, players would fight for the glory of their clans. Simulating alternate realities, filled with hostile environments and treacherous situations, the Grid would test and push participants past their limits.</p>
