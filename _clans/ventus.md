Ventus consists of thinkers and intellectuals. With their ability to think out of the box and their ingenuity, they are able to alter the Gridâ€™s artificial law of nature to their benefit. Controlling the elements is simple and common to them. This allows Ventus to face natural disasters with ease, giving them an edge in the simulations.
